**I need help setting up GitHub Pages for my repository. Here's my situation:**

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Seanpenny/forever-_website

- **What I need:** I need to enable GitHub Pages to deploy my static website (index.html, CSS, JS files) so I can share the link with someone
- **Goal:** Deploy my website to https://seanpenny.github.io/forever-_website/

**Questions:**
