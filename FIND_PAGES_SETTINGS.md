# How to Find GitHub Pages Settings

## ⚠️ Important: You Must Be in REPOSITORY Settings, Not Profile Settings!

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to your repository** (not your profile):
   - Visit: https://github.com/Seanpenny/forever-_website
   - Make sure you're ON the repository page (you should see "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", etc. tabs)

2. **Click the "Settings" tab** at the TOP of the repository page
   - It's next to "Insights" and "Security"
   - NOT the Settings in the top-right corner (that's your profile settings)

3. **Scroll down the LEFT sidebar** until you see:
   - Code and automation
   - Security
   - **Pages** ← This is what you're looking for!

4. **Click "Pages"** in the left sidebar

5. **Under "Source"**, select:
   - **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
   - Click **Save**
