# Deploy Your LOCAL Project to Vercel (Not GitHub)

## The Problem:
- Vercel deployed from GitHub (old version)
- Your local folder has the NEW version
- GitHub push failed (files too large)

## Solution: Deploy Local Folder Directly

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest!)
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Click "Deploy" tab (not Import)
4. Drag your entire "Forever fit website" folder
5. Drop it on Vercel page
6. Wait for deployment
7. Done! Your current project is live!

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (Command Line)
If you want automatic updates:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel` in your project folder
3. Follow prompts
4. Your site deploys!

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 (drag & drop) - it's fastest!
